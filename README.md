Major project :- 
 A fire extinguisher robot is a device which is programmed to detect temperature, and provide an indication of possibility of fire. A simple fire
extinguisher robot is used to generate an alarm in case a fire occurs, so that immediate help
can be produced to the site, manually.
Such robots have two main components: (i) temperature sensor (usually a thermometer) and
(ii) a microcontroller, containing a code to generate spray water on the site of fire as soon as
the temperature exceeds a certain value.
Through this project, we intend to design and develop an IoT based fire extinguisher robot,
with additional components to enable to not only extinguish fire, but is also capable to
traversing a building to hunt for any instances of temperature rise, and then contacting the
nearby fire brigade stations, spraying water along with Carbon dioxide gas as a preventive
measure.
